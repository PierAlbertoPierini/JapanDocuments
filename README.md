## About This Repository

This repository contains important documents related to my stay in Japan. Since many official Japanese documents are only available in Japanese, and other services provide translations in other languages only if paid for, I will translate them and make them accessible here in multiple languages, currently in English, French, and Italian. The translation within the spreadsheets is made automatic with just the choice of the language. Additionally, the repository is designed to easily incorporate more languages in the future to assist a broader audience. I have structured the spreadsheet tables to facilitate the addition of other languages, aiming to help more people access this information.

## File Format

For documents that require structured data (like forms or spreadsheets), I'll use the **FODS** format. It's an open, XML-based file format supported by spreadsheet software like LibreOffice and is easy to work with in an open-source environment.

However, if you need to convert these files to other formats (e.g., `.xlsx`, `.csv`, `.ods`), it's possible to do so using online services. One such service is [GroupDocs Conversion App](https://products.groupdocs.app/conversion/total), which allows fast and free conversions. Please note that conversions may result in minor formatting issues depending on the complexity of the file and the tool used.

## Files
