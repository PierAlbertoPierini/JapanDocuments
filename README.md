## About This Repository

This repository contains important documents related to my stay in Japan. Since many official Japanese documents are only available in Japanese or the English version are payed one, I will translate them and make them accessible here in English.

## File Format

For documents that require structured data (like forms or spreadsheets), I'll use the **FODS** format. It's an open, XML-based file format supported by spreadsheet software like LibreOffice and is easy to work with in an open-source environment.

However, if you need to convert these files to other formats (e.g., `.xlsx`, `.csv`, `.ods`), it's possible to do so using online services. One such service is [GroupDocs Conversion App](https://products.groupdocs.app/conversion/total), which allows fast and free conversions. Please note that conversions may result in minor formatting issues depending on the complexity of the file and the tool used.
